                              Org-ehtml
             export Org-mode files as editable web pages

DESCRIPTION
    Org-ehtml allows for interactively viewing and editing Org-mode
    files through a web browser.  The Emacs web server [1] serves
    Org-mode files as editable HTML exported with a special ox-ehtml
    backend which extends the standard Org-mode HTML export.

REQUIREMENTS
    Emacs 24.3 or later and the Emacs web server [1].

USAGE
    1. Install from melpa [2] or source.

       [2]  http://melpa.milkbox.net/

    2. Optionally run the tests suite.

       (require 'test-org-ehtml)
       (ert "org-ehtml")

    3. Configure Org-ehtml to serve a directory of Org-mode files on
       your machine (e.g., "~/public_org"), and set all fields to be
       editable.

       ;; NOTE: the org-ehtml-docroot value should be fully expanded
       (setq org-ehtml-docroot (expand-file-name "~/public_org"))
       (setq org-ehtml-everything-editable t)

    4. Start up the web server.

       (require 'org-ehtml)
       (ws-start org-ehtml-handler 8888)

    5. Point your browser to [3] select a page, and move your mouse
       over the page.  Editable portions of the page will be
       highlighted, click on these to edit.

EXTENSIONS

    Integration with Version Control

      (require 'vc)

      (add-hook
       'org-ehtml-after-save-hook
       (lambda (request)
         (let ((file (buffer-file-name (current-buffer))))
           (vc-checkin (list file)
                       (vc-backend file) nil "edit through org-ehtml"))))

    Authentication

      NOTE: This uses HTTP BASIC authentication which is only secure
      when used over a secure (HTTPS) connection.

      Use the `ws-with-authentication' function to protect org-ehtml
      functionality with credentials.  For example, the following
      requires all edits require a user supplies the username "admin"
      and the password "password".

          (setf (cdr (assoc '(:POST . ".*") org-ehtml-handler))
                (ws-with-authentication 'org-ehtml-edit-handler
                                        '(("admin" . "password"))))

    Agenda View

      Org-ehtml supports viewing the Agenda buffer.  It can be enabled
      by setting org-ehtml-allow-agenda to a non-nil value.  The
      agenda can be viewed by adding /agenda/CMD to the url with CMD
      being one of the following.

      day, week, fortnight, month, year:
        Show org-agenda-list in that range.  For example [4] will show
        the agenda for the specified day.  An additional argument can
        be provided to set the start date.

        [4]  http://localhost:8888/agenda/day/2013-11-11

      any natural number:
        Show org-agenda-list for that many days.  Similar to using
        day, week, etc.

      todo:
        Show org-todo-list.

      tags:
        Show org-tags-view.  It requires an additional argument
        (separated by a /) specifying the tag.  Using todo as first
        argument will limit the search to TODO entries.  For example
        [5] will show all headlines tagged :work: and [6] will only
        show headlines tagged :work: and marked TODO.
